Hi folks, some very important announcements:

* ZoneMinder just released a stable version of 1.29. Please upgrade your ZM instances asap for those running a development snapshot. This particular version fixes a nasty bug that resulted in data being used more than required in zmNinja. Those running ZoneMinder 1.29 on the development release **will not** have this fix - specifically [this one](https://github.com/ZoneMinder/ZoneMinder/issues/1253)

* I've just released 1.0.6 of ZmNinja - as usual it has some important bug fixes and a very cool new feature called "Event Montage" - I'll post more on that later.

* The new release of zmNinja no longer needs you to install your self-signed SSL ceritificates on the phone.

* zmNinja 1.0.6 Changelog  is [here](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
