zmNinja is now a Polyglot! Rather, its ready to be a multi-lingual app. The app has been refactored for internationalization, but I need **your** help with language files. If you want to see zmNinja in your language, please consider contributing a language file. For more instructions, please see [this](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/tree/master/www/lang). If you have questions, please feel free to connect with me.
