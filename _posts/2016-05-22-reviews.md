Hey there, I hope you like the recently released 1.1.92 release of zmNinja, with many fixes and enhancements. I was hoping you'd find some time to leave a written review (however short) for zmNinja on [play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pliablepixels.zmninja_pro&hl=en) or [app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zmninja-pro/id1067914954?mt=8) (as applicable). Reviews are very useful to the developer and more than anything else, we love to hear from folks who like our work.

If you are experiencing issues, by all means, leave a review with a lower rating, but only if you are sure its not a bug on your side. I always urge users to first post a github [issue](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/issues) so we can figure out if its a problem with ZoneMinder or a bug in zmNinja.
