<b>Click <a href="

Holy Bugmarole! I released 1.2.0 a few days ago, _after_ testing both debug and release builds thoroughly and I started driving home.
By the time I drove 15 minutes, I got 10 emails about the app not starting. Boom. 

To cut a long story short, there were two users who actually helped tremendously - Christopher Abramson and Tim Sharpe. While the others were busy taking out ratings in the playstore (don't blame them!) these folks offered their help and after a lot of testing, we figured out that the DB change I implemented (for the better) was crashing only on _some_ Android devices. And yes, there were some other errors too.

Anyway, I figure I can't test on every possible device. And since zmNinja is login based, the "pre-launch report" of Android where the app is run on multiple devices doesn't really help.

So from now on, I'm opening the beta program publicly. Please join by clicking on <a href="
https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.pliablepixels.zmninja_pro">THIS</a> link. And please shoot me an <a href="mailto:pliablepixels@gmail.com">email</a> when you join! This requires you to be a zmNinja Android customer. Once you have the play store app, join the beta program, and you'll get beta updates. You can leave this program anytime by visiting the same link.

Love for you to help (pretty please!) - by testing betas, so I can avoid disasters like this (and save on many hours of my nights). 

Oh and Chris and Tim, thanks for your patience - happy to take you out for beer (or wine) if we ever meet!
