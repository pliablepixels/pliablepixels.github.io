title: A note about the Desktop clients

It seems the desktop client has become more popular than expected. While the Android and iOS versions are priced at a fee, the desktop versions are free. However, please note that the same license applies - it is free for 'personal' use. What that means is if you are running a commercial service based on zoneminder and are charging your users a fee (fixed or monthly), even if you are "giving away" the desktop client for free, you are still violating its use as it is a commercial deployment.

Thanks to all those who have reached out asking to license zmNinja-desktops for commercial deployments (even if the app is 'sold' as 'free'). For those of you who are making money off a ZoneMinder deployment and are encouraging users to download zmNinja-desktop on their own, please know you are not doing it right.

Thanks
