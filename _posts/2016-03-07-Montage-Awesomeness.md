So what have I've been working on lately? Besides wrapping up feature requests and bug reports, I've decided to do a amajor revamp of the Montage screen. As it turns out, a lot of people spend a lot of time looking at that screen, so why not give it more design and functionality love? Everyone seems to have an opinion on size and order of the screens, so how about we give you full power? Take a look at the sneak preview. It's mostly working - need to iron out some kinks.
