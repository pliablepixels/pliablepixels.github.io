Hey folks, Release 1.1.0 made it out today.
I've released them for all platforms (including iOS). iOS users however
have to wait till the Apple review folks pass the app (which takes a few weeks)

This release has many updates, the biggest ones being

a) A fully reworked montage screen - you can now re-arrange monitors, resize each one individually and do awesome stuff. This was the most wanted feature as it seems most of you spend most of your time on the montage screen. I've also added a "reset" button to the montage screen if you get to excited and do too much :-). Note that when you first start the app, it will reset your existing montage settings. Sorry for the inconvenience.

Oh and I mention you can also drag and drop them around?

b) 24hr format for my friends around the world (enable it in Dev Settings)

c) You can now navigate the timeline on a day-day basis

Please read full CHANGELOG [here](https://github.com/pliablepixels/zmNinja/blob/v1.1.0/CHANGELOG.md)

Some sample images of what you can do:
