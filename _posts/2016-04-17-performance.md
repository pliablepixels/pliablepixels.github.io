Hi folks, this post only applies to mobile users.
And specifically, Android users.

Here is the bottom line I know the app scrolling and view transitions can be sluggish on certain devices. Are you one of the folks who are experiencing slow scroll or transition performance ? If so, I'd like you to be a beta tester for a new version where I am experimenting with native transitions and scrolling. Based on my limited testing, I'm seeing very smooth Android performance (there are some minor annoyances, but the speed makes up for it).

If you are interested in beta testing, please shoot me an email to pliablepixels at gmail. Please make sure you have already purchased the app from the play store. ** If you do send me an email, please make sure you write back on whether you see improvements or not **`


iOS users - I don't think you'll see any difference. iOS performance has always been good, methinks
