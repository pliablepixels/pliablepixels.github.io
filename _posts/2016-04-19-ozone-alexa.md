Hey there! So this is not a zmNinja post.  Its about a peek into the future of man-machine interfacing.

So what's the next frontier for revolutionizing human to machine interaction? Is it going to be a profileration of apps, one per device that the user needs to launch to control these new amazing devices? We don't think so. That sucks. While there are efforts like the <a href="https://google.github.io/physical-web/">"physical web"</a>, voice based interactions are likely going to play an important role. But its no fun having to press a button to activate voice, hey? Well, that's where Amazon's amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Amazon-SK705DI-Echo/dp/B00X4WHP5E">Echo</a> product comes in. Always powered and always listening, its an ideal platform for you to use Echo/Alexa service to interact. 

Now if only we could use Alexa to talk to oZone (umm, that's ZoneMinder on steroids) so I can hands free get a summary of events on demand! Well, that's what this post is all about! Thanks to Amazon's <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/appsandservices/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit">Alexa Skill Kit</a>, we can do just that.

Did you know ZoneMinder is an awesome software and its APIs allow for amazing things? For example, how about asking Alexa to report on recent events without you having to use an app? Well, I just prototyped some basic functionality.

Oh and this is the first time I'm talking about <a href="http://ozone.network">oZone</a>. oZone is the 'innovation layer' on top of ZoneMinder. We want to develop cool and powerful stuff on top of ZoneMinder and hopefully commercialize it too.  And yes, oZone is powered by the same folks who are key contributors to ZoneMinder itself :-). Now how cool is that? When will ozone hit the market? Read the <a href="http://ozone.network">footer of our wepage</a>.

So anyway, enjoy a sneak preview of Alexa/Echo integration:
