I've just released 1.2.27 for zmNinja and this includes various bug fixes (which you can read in the CHANGELOG). This release is all about usability improvements.

**Shrinking Headers**

When looking at a laundry list of events, screen real estate matters. I've tweaked the headers for all the screens of zmNinja so that when you scroll, the headers "squeeze out" of display giving you a little bit more screen space to see your content. When you start scrolling back up, it comes right back up.

**Focus on relative time**

When you look at events, what's the most natural question you ask? Do you ask "Show me events from Oct 15, 10AM - Oct 15, 1PM" or do you more often ask "Show me events starting 3 hours ago" ?
I'd bet its the latter more than the former. This is why I've incorporated 'relative time' everywhere.

If you look at the events screen, you now see this:
<img class="img-responsive" src = "/public/images/oct15-list.png">

Right at the top of each row you'll see what matters the most - how old is the event relative to your current time. Another usability tweak I did here was move the time to the left and in the red box and put the date to the righ. I think this is a more natural layout when you are reading from left to right - you will see the time before the date, which is probably what you will want to focus on first anyway. I do realize that zmNinja now supports multiple languages, so for "Right to Left" languages, this may have the opposite effect - I may add an RTL feature for that in the future.

**Event Montage Redux**
I had implemented Event Montage a long time ago, but really did not give it much love - doing a proper Event Montage is hard on Mobile devices for many reasons including network delays. Well, I've completely reworked Event Montage and it how has individual graph displays and drag bars you can slide around making it so much more useful.

And I've also simplified it - I've added relative time here too - you can select to see events "X hrs ago" in addition to being able to specify a custom from time. I've taken out "To" time - I think its completely redundant - To time is current time now.

Enjoy zmNinja and thanks for your support!
