Hey there! I just released version 1.0.9. Besides many bug fixes, I have also now added an option
to play events footage via ZMS. This will result in much smoother playback for those who
are on networks that are slow, are on servers that are not fast. To enable ZMS event playback
for your surveillance footage, make sure "use ZMS for events footage" is enabled.
Also please take note of the new "Event single image scale" setting - you can now
control the quality of playback for event montage and single event playback separately.
