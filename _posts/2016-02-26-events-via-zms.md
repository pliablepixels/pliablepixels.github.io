title: New feature- events via ZMS - smoother playback

Hey there! I just released version 1.0.9. Besides many bug fixes, I have also now added an option
to play events footage via ZMS. This will result in much smoother playback for those who
are on networks that are slow, are on servers that are not fast. To enable ZMS event playback
for your surveillance footage, make sure "use ZMS for events footage" is enabled.
Also please take note of the new "Event single image scale" setting - you can now
control the quality of playback for event montage and single event playback separately.

Note that using zms for events changes the features available compared to the other mode. Specifically:
a) You won't be able to scrub the slider around
b) You will not see alarmed frames marked

You do gain more playback stability and the ability to rewind (i.e. watch your playbacks forward and back)
